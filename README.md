# Using-python-in-numerical-methods-
This repository contains a Python programs that utilize the matplot and numpy library. Numpy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Matplotlib is a data visualization library that provides a wide range of tools for creating plots, charts, and graphs in Python. 

Introduction: The Python Repository aims to provide a Python scripts that demonstrate the capabilities of the Numpy and matplot library. Whether you are a beginner learning programming or an experienced developer interested in exploring the usage of python in numerical method.

Installation: To use the programs in this repository, you need to have Python and the Numpy and matplot library installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python, visit the official Python website and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

Usage: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file. Once you have the repository on your system, you can explore the various Python scripts. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.

To execute a script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository's directory, and run the Python command followed by the script's filename. For example: python tutorial.py You can also open the scripts in a Python IDE or code editor of your choice and run them from there.
